# `elm-ui` a Language for Layout and Interface


## _Why?_ üò¢ `|>` üòç

People who are learning `CSS`
(_or those who are too impatient to learn and just want it to "work now"!_),
often end up feeling like `CSS` is a wild beast that cannot be tamed.

In reality, CSS _can_ be learned/mastered reasonably quickly
and _amazing_ things can be made e.g:
http://www.csszengarden.com and https://www.cssdesignawards.com

Sadly, it doesn't matter how well
_you_ - the conscientious developer/designer - learn CSS.
Unless you can ensure that _everyone_ in your team/company
has the same level of skill and care in their work,
it's _inevitable_ that over-time
duplicate and _conflicting_ styles will be added.

Take any popular website and run it through CSS Stats https://cssstats.com
to see how many styles are being used.
A good example is [Twitter.com](https://twitter.com)
Their CSS is **632kb**

That might not sound like a lot,
but scroll down to the part that says **1024 total color declarations**:

Can you tell the difference between those shades of grey, blue and _white_??
The point is that the developers/designers at Twitter - a tech company
with **billions** in revenue and some of the most talented people -
do not have _control_ over their CSS.

> Twitter are the creators of Bootstrap
"_the most popular front-end framework in the world_".
**Bootstrap	`v4`** is **123kb** (_uncompressed_)
and **23kb** (_compressed+gzipped_).
The _whole_ library including grid layout,
typography, colors, all compontents, forms and utilities.
Bootstrap is meant to be a _complete_ responsive grid-based design system
that _anyone_ can use to build their App/website.
And yet twitter, which has a _great_ in-house design team
with their own _system_ and component library,
have managed to build a



The problem isn't you, the problem is the (_lack of a_) _system_.


@dwyl we _love_ the idea of having semantic and functional UIs
with no side-effects. Functional CSS allows you to change one style
without affecting any others. For the past few years

## _What?_

`elm-ui` is to `HTML` and `CSS`
what `elm` is to `JavaScript`.
`elm-ui` offers compile-time guarantees that your layout and styles.


## _How?_

In a new directory, initialise your `elm` workflow with the following command:
```sh
elm init
```

That will create an `elm.json` file similar to this one:
[`elm.json`]()

Next we will add the dependency for `mdgriffith/elm-ui`:
```sh
elm install mdgriffith/elm-ui
```
> **Note**: that command will only add an entry
in the `elm.json` `"dependencies"` section.
`elm install` does not actually _install_ anything.
